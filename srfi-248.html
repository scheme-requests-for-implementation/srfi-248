    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      Scheme's exception system is extended so that exception handlers
      gain access to the delimited continuation representing the rest
      of the computation of the call of the thunk guarded by the
      handler.  Algebraic effect handlers can be directly expressed in
      this extended exception system.  The system directly implements
      the <code>shift0</code>/<code>reset0</code> delimited control
      operators.  It is well known that other delimited control
      operators like <code>prompt0</code>/<code>control0</code> or
      <code>reset</code>/<code>shift</code> are expressible
      in <code>shift0</code>/<code>reset0</code> (and vice versa).
    </p>

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <p>None at present.</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>Scheme was the first programming language with first-class
      continuations.  Since their invention, it has become
      increasingly clear that they do not provide the right
      abstraction in many use cases, but should be supplemented by
      delimited continuations, which only represent a portion of the
      rest of the computation.  While delimited continuations are
      becoming popular in other programming languages, they still have
      to find their way into a Scheme standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-226/srfi-226.html">SRFI
      226</a> is an extensive proposal to add many control structures,
      including delimited continuations, in a coherent way to Scheme.
      Due to its size and far-reaching consequences, it does, however,
      place a burden not be underestimated on implementers of Scheme.
      For a future standard comparable in size with R<sup>6</sup>RS or
      R<sup>7</sup>RS, a minimal API supporting delimited
      continuations might be more appropriate.  This SRFI proposes such
      an API.  It integrates smoothly into the existing facilities by
      hooking into Scheme's exception system, and only comes with one
      primitive procedure (and extends the existing <code>guard</code>
      convenience syntax).

    <p>
      This SRFI dispenses with the idea of prompt tags as in other
      systems for delimited continuation (but it is possible to
      implement a delimited continuation system with prompt tags with
      it).  If it were not for <code>call/cc</code>, the system could
      dispense with <code>dynamic-wind</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>In the following examples, we use the <code>guard</code>
    syntax, which is a convenient syntactic abstraction over the
    primitive <code>with-unwind-handler</code> procedure.  Both
    are defined in the <a href="#specification">specification
    section</a>.</p>

    <p>The following is a version
      of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-158/srfi-158.html">SRFI
        158</a>'s <code>make-coroutine-generator</code> that
      prevents the space leaks inherent to the sample implementation
      of SRFI 158, which uses <code>call/cc</code>.  This version, which uses delimited
      continuations, is also easier to understand.
    </p>

    <pre>(define make-coroutine-generator
  (lambda (proc)
    (define-condition-type &amp;yield &amp;condition
      make-yield-condition yield-condition?
      (value condition-value))
    (define yield
      (lambda (val)
        (raise-continuable (make-yield-condition val))))
    (define thunk
      (lambda ()
        (guard (c k
                  [(yield-condition? c)
                   (set! thunk k)
                   (condition-value c)])
          (proc yield)
          (eof-object))))
    (lambda ()
      (thunk))))</pre>

    <p>The next example shows how delimited continuations and the API
    of this SRFI in particular can be used to transform a procedure
    with <code>for-each</code>-like semantics describing an abstract
    list into a procedure with <code>fold</code>-like semantics
    describing the same abstract list.  Notably, the implementation
    does not use state, which would be incompatible with the existence
    of <code>call/cc</code>.

    <pre>(define for-each->fold
  (lambda (for-each)
    (define-condition-type &amp;yield &amp;condition
      make-yield-condition yield-condition?
      (value condition-value))
    (lambda (proc nil)
      ((guard (c k
                 [(yield-condition? c)
                  (lambda (s)
                    ((k) (proc s (condition-value c))))])
         (for-each
           (lambda (x)
             (raise-continuable (make-yield-condition x))))
         values)
       nil)))

  (define string-fold
    (lambda (proc seed s)
      (define for-each-s (lambda (proc) (string-for-each proc s)))
      (define fold-s (for-each->fold for-each-s))
      (fold-s proc seed))))</pre>

    <p>More examples can be found in the <a href="tests.scm">bundled
        test cases</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <p>The following syntax and procedures are provided by the <code>(srfi
        :248 exceptions)</code> and <code>(srfi :248)</code> libraries
      (R<sup>6</sup>RS) and by the <code>(srfi 248)</code> library
      (R<sup>7</sup>RS).</p>

    <h3>Procedures</h3>

    <p><code>(with-unwind-handler</code> <var>handler</var> <var>thunk</var><code>)</code></p>

    <p><var>Handler</var> must be a procedure and should accept two
      arguments.  <var>Thunk</var> must be a procedure that accepts zero
      arguments.  The <code>with-unwind-handler</code> procedure
      returns the results of invoking <var>thunk</var>.  An anonymous
      handler is installed as the current exception handler for the
      dynamic extent (as determined by <code>dynamic-wind</code>) of the
      invocation of <var>thunk</var>.</p>

    <p>When the anonymous handler is invoked on an
      object <var>obj</var> as a result of a call
      to <code>raise</code> or <code>raise-continuable</code>, it
      packages the portion of the current continuation up to and
      including the call to <code>with-unwind-handler</code> that
      installed the anonymous handler in a &ldquo;delimited
      continuation procedure&rdquo; <var>k</var>.  It then
      applies <var>handler</var> on <var>obj</var> and <var>k</var> in
      the continuation and dynamic environment of the call
      to <code>with-unwind-handler</code>.</p>

    <p>Implementation responsibilities (R<sup>6</sup>RS): The
      implementation must check the restrictions on <var>handler</var>
      to the extent performed by applying it as described when it is
      called as a result of a call to <code>raise</code>
      or <code>raise-continuable</code>.  An implementation may check
      whether <code>handler</code> is an appropriate argument before
      applying it.</p>

    <p><code>(with-exception-handler</code> <var>handler</var> <var>thunk</var><code>)</code></p>

    This procedure is the same as in R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS.

    <p><code>(raise</code> <var>obj</var><code>)</code></p>

    This procedure is the same as in R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS.

    <p><code>(raise-continuable</code> <var>obj</var><code>)</code></p>

    This procedure is the same as in R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS.

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p><code>(guard</code> (&langle;variable&rangle;
    &langle;continuation variable&rangle; &langle;cond
    clause<sub>1</sub>&rangle; &langle;cond clause<sub>1</sub>&rangle;
    &hellip;<code>)</code> &langle;body&rangle;<code>)</code>
      <br>
      <code>=&gt;</code>
      <br>
      <code>else</code>
    </p>

    <p><i>Syntax:</i> &langle;Cond clause&rangle; is as in the
      specification of <code>cond</code>.  <code>=&gt;</code>
      and <code>else</code> are the same as in R<sup>6</sup>RS and
      R<sup>7</sup>RS.
    </p>

    <p><i>Semantics:</i> Evaluating a guard form evaluates
      &langle;body&rangle; with an anonymous exception handler that
      packages the portion of the current continuation up to and
      including the evaluation of the <code>guard</code> form in a
      delimited continuation procedure.  It then binds the raised
      exception to &langle;variable&rangle; and the captured delimited
      continuation procedure to &langle;continuation variable&rangle;,
      and within the scope of that bindings evaluates the clauses as if
      they were the clauses of a <code>cond</code> expression.  The
      implicit <code>cond</code> expression is evaluated within the
      continuation and dynamic environment of the <code>guard</code>
      expression.  If every &langle;cond clause&rangle;'s
      &langle;test&rangle; evaluates to <code>#f</code> and there is
      no <code>else</code> clause, then <code>raise-continuable</code>
      is invoked on the raised object, and the captured delimited
      continuation procedure is applied to the values returned by the
      call to <code>raise-continuable</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The final expression in a &langle;cond clause&rangle;
      is in a tail context if the <code>guard</code> expression itself is.
    </p>

    <p><code>(guard</code> (&langle;variable&rangle; &langle;cond clause<sub>1</sub>&rangle; &langle;cond clause<sub>1</sub>&rangle; &hellip;<code>)</code> &langle;body&rangle;<code>)</code></p>

    <p>This syntactic form is the same as in R<sup>6</sup>RS (with errata
      applied) and R<sup>7</sup>RS (with the tail context specification
      as in R<sup>6</sup>RS).</p>

    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

    <p>A portable implementation of delimited continuations (which
      uses <code>call/cc</code> and global state) is only possible by
      at least replacing the user-visible <code>call/cc</code>.
      This is analogous to the fact that <code>dynamic-wind</code> can be
      implemented by using <code>call/cc</code> and global state, but
      only by replacing the user-visible <code>call/cc</code>.
    </p>

    <p>This SRFI is implementable in any Scheme that supports any form
      of delimited continuations compatible with <code>call/cc</code>
      and <code>dynamic-wind</code>.  We provide a
      <a href="lib/srfi/srfi-248.scm">a sample implementation for Guile</a>.</p>
